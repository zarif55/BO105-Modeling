%% find_wake_model




% assume bound circulation is linear distributed bound circulation constant 
% constant circulation based on thrust 1.
% wake model to predict velocity tip onto the blade circulation bound
% prescibed wake model and circul strength
% new angles of attack 
% and re run BET code
% 
% unifrom inflow when you apply velocity induced wake average same as uniform inflow
% thrust 
% inflow 
% criculuation
% advance ratio
% and then geometry 
% need stregth from down velocity model 1.
% then biot savart to get induced velocity by wake
